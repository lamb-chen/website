Being ill has meant I have had a lot of time to think. Think about what? About anything but mostly about how my body feels. The aches, tiredness and pains. Increasingly I want to spend time alone, though I have tried to fight this by asking flatmates if they want to go on a run with me. I have started to prefer chatting over listening to music on runs. However if I cannot muster the courage, I sit in my own bubble in my room or kitchen. Being in company is nice but more draining that it should be. I also fear I am not enjoyable to be around with my constant hacking and coughing, sucking in energy rather than it radiating out. A few more days of rest should fix me up. By this time next week, I hope to look back on this and think, what a silly sausage I was - I am right as rain now!
