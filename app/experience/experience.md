~ things I've learnt alot from


### **𖦹 Google Developer Student Club Lead for Bristol // Technical Events Officer for Computer Science Society**   

🛠️ **Leadership, Organisation, Creativity, Networking, Teamwork, Communication, Time Management**      
📅 **Sep 2023 - June 2024**  
📍 **Bristol, UK**  

My eyes finally opened to how much effort and time it takes to organise events and it has really made me appreciate all the events I have ever attended in a different way. I experienced working with a diverse group of people and connecting with new people.

There was also no previous GDSC Club established for the University of Bristol, bringing me the opportunity to learn how to grow a club from nothing.   

Lessons on leadership I discovered:
- You need to define specific tasks for your team to do. The more information and detail you give, the better the tasks will be executed. This means more efficient, faster and higher quality.
- Encourage more communication
- Patience is important!

### **𖦹 Winning JP Morgan's Code for Good Hackathon**  

🛠️ **React.js, Flask, SQLite**      
📅 **Dec 2023**  
📍 **London, UK**  

This was my first proper hackathon! I attended my university one in first year, as well as some online ones but nothing like this! I also completed my first all nighter and thankfully it paid off as we won, aaaa! My team developed a technological solution for [Make-A-Wish® UK](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/) using React.js, Flask and SQLite to connect their volunteers with community leads and wishes. I really enjoyed working together to understand exactly what the Make-A-Wish envisioned and required, then designing something that ticked all the boxes. I am very proud of all the hard work my teammates put in. We worked very well together and it felt that we had know each other much longer than just 24 hours.

### **𖦹 Back-end engineer intern at Thought Machine**  

🛠️ **Golang, Kafka**      
📅 **July-Sep 2023**  
📍 **London, UK**

10 week internship as a back-end engineer intern at Thought Machine. My project was to create a internally used command line tool that automatically connected to an environment, created a Kafka consumer and producer and sent a json/proto file to test environments. This is to reduce the time taken and room for error during testing. At the end of the internship, we all presented our projects and experience to the entire company, including the CEO. I learnt SO SO SO much in these 10 weeks and am so grateful to have had this opportunity.

### **𖦹 Harvard CS50’s Intro to Python Course**  

🛠️ **Python**      
📅 **Dec 2022**   
📍 **Online**  

Completing this course allowed me to deepen my Python skills through practicing by solving nine problem sets and one final project. From this I became familiar with unit testing, regular expressions and object orientated programming using Python.
