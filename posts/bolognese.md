All day a particular vision for a bolognese haunted me. A few weeks ago my friend P had made me bolognese and today I could not stop thinking about it. I just knew I had to make it for me and my flatmate!

The key is to chop everything as fine and small as possible. P sent me [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Ut1H659lU) as guidance and I eyeballed everything else.

### Ingredients  
I roughly added
- 1: carrot, celery, white onion, small bottle of Sainbsury's Merlot (18.7cl), entire tube of tomato paste (i feel the concentration was not high enough), cup of warm water, beef stock pot
- 4 garlic cloves
- 750g 5% fat beef mince
- 2 bay leaves
- seasoning: salt, black pepper, mixed herbs, italian herbs, thyme
- topping: parmesan cheese, double cream, parsley

### Method  
1 - Fry carrot, celery, onion and minced garlic with salt and a generous amount of olive oil   
2 - Add beef and fry until fully cooked   
3 - Add tomato paste, cook with beef for a bit  

the tomato paste concerningly resembled red acrylic paint...

5 - add red wine

6 - add water and beef stock pot  
7- season and boil off until at desired consistency  
8 - cook pasta   
My boyfrend got me a dutch oven for Christmas and it is simply perfect for cooking this meal ^-^

### Review   
IT TASTED SO GOOD! DELICIOUS, YUMMY, SCRUMMY, DELECTABLE!! My appetite recently reduced from being ill but this has set me back straight. My flatmates all wanted some hehehe I am looking forward to eating this again tomorrow mmmm. This will definitely become a new staple, it's so easy to make. One pot wonder!

P had also added double cream to dilute the saltiness of the sauce as he had added too much salt. I am unsure on the discourse surrounding adding cream to bolognese but I enjoyed it so did the same. I added the cream directly to the bowl so the sauce would keep better in the fridge.
