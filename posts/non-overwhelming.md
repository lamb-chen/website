Pinch punch first of the month!    

Recently I was told to truly embrace uncertainty. There will always be new things to learn, see, do, try, but I now realise that is what gives me a sense of purpose. I should not let my fuel turn into poison by letting it overwhelm me. Not knowing everything is okay. Sometimes I feel guilty when people ask me if I know someone, or something, and I have to reply no. It's as if I have disappointed them by not being able to share this reference, except, it's not *actually* like that. The person is likely more than happy to share something new into someone else's life. Similar to the feeling of when you show a friend a song they have not heard, and they go on to listen to it on loop frequently. I was asked how I learn (besides university), and it struck me with immediate fear. Do I even learn anything beyond my course? But then I automatically responded: "I learn from all the people I interact each day".   
  
As time has passed, I have discovered this rings true more and more. The morning breakfast conversations with my flatmates teach me about politics, how people think, pop-culture, ways to combine food, history, life advice, the list goes on.
