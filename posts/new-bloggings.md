Happy Valentine's Day!  

Initially inspired by [Benedict Neo's](bneo.xyz) website, I decided to embark on my own journey to create my very own website. 

### 1: Breaking the ice

Following [pixegami's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiabp1GY8fA) to understand the basics of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and create the skeleton of this blog.

#### Things I learnt:
- Download node, Next.JS and npm on WSL - NOT on Windows! It won't work :<
    Helpful links for setting up your environment:
    - [Set up WSL environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#file-storage)
    - [Installing Next.js](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nextjs-on-wsl)
    - [Setting up Node.js on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl)
- Use WSL and do not create your Next.js project in /mnt/c/...

### 2: Static blogs(?)
```npm run build``` to see which pages are static vs which are rendering at runtime. It appears this blog is fully static but I am still trying to learn what that really means.

### 3: Adding a navbar
I used Lee Robinson's navbar code and adjusted it to my own preferences.
- [Lee's portfolio site](https://leerob.io/)  
- [Lee's github repo for his site](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io)  

### 4: Deployed on Vercel...contemplating domain
I deployed this site on Vercel (thanks Benedict for the guidance)! Not sure when I will get my own domain. I want to be happy with the site and there's no rush anyway!

### 5: Adding pages and styling
No use for a navbar if there aren't any pages to navigate to! Lots of adjusting and styling of the different components. Colour picking could be a full time job.
