~ additional invaluable experiences i have had

### **𖦹 Gold, Silver and Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Awards**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication**      
📅 **June 2022 - Sep 2022**  
📍 **UK**  

Ah yes, I was told by everyone around me that [Duke of Edinburgh (DofE)](https://www.dofe.org/) would be my way of getting into university. In hindsight, I am not sure how true that is but I certainly learnt a lot from it.

It helped provide a motivation for me to try different sports, volunteering roles, and develop new skills or hobbies. My parents only moved to the UK after I was born so were unaware of the clubs I could become involved in. Consequently, I only started doing extracurricular clubs after starting DofE. I tried kickboxing, drama, baking, and joined a local volleyball club, which grew from 1 year to 5 years of volleyball. I kickstarted my running journey for Gold and went from seriously struggling to complete 1500m in PE to being able to do weekly 10ks. I volunteered at my local Beaver Scout group, as well as a local charity shop. Interacting with a variety of different customers was always fun and hugely improved my confidence in speaking to new people.

I was also lucky to have been able to hike along the beauitful Jurassic Coast (Silver Expedition) and Lake District (Gold Expedition). Never thought I would ever be immersed in such gorgeous nature!

### **𖦹 Conservation with John Muir Award – Flatford Mill**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication**      
📅 **June 2022 - Sep 2022**  
📍 **Flatford Mill, UK**  

As part of my Gold DofE, I needed to complete a 1-week residential of some sort. My friend suggested we go to Flatford Mill together as she had an interest in conservation. Having no previous knowledge in conservation, I decided to go too to learn more about it!
