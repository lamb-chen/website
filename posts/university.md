Everyone has differing opinions on university. How they want to spend their time at university, why you shouldn't go to university, etc. For me, university has really helped me discover a lot about myself and grow. After two years, a common feeling amongst my friends is the fear of this all ending. Being able to live with your closest friends, and eating almost every meal together. Meeting new people and learning something different every single day. Having full automony of your time beyond lectures and labs. The looming thought of no longer being this free once I graduate haunts me.
