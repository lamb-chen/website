My favourite part of visiting a new place is when the streets start becoming familiar and a mental map of the area begins to form. You no longer need assitance to navigate to the nearest bus stop or supermarket. Revisiting these places with your imagination is like hearing a song associated with a certain memory again. Every emotion, scent, and taste of that place can be fully relived. How bittersweet.

I will add to this - I really like thinking about it.
