This is in relation to classification.  

Loss functions measure how well models fit data. If we have loss function *L(a)*, we want to find the value of the tunable parameter *a* that minimises the loss *L(a)*. Calculus can solve this optimisation problem, namely differentiation. 
Minimum of the loss is often where the gradient is zero, though the gradient can also be zero at the maximum or saddle points. So, by differentiating the loss function and finding the value of a when that is at a minimum, we can minimise the loss.  

More specifcially, for classification...TBC
