I worry occasionally that the meaning conveyed when decoding my thoughts into speech may become lost in translation. 
Sometimes the cause is that I have not thought for long or in enough depth about what I would like to say, 
others I feel I am limited by my vocabulary. At times I am in fact thinking of multiple things in parallel. There is an underlying thought that is buried amongst the cracks slowly unearthing within the same moment. Naturally, most people stress about communicating across what they truly mean.    

However articulation may not be the only worry. Instead it may be the actual substance and original meaning, or the flow of the conversation. I saw a youtube comment saying to elicit narrative responses. Do not ask questions or prompts that could result in a plain yes or no answer. For example, "What do you like about the meal?" rather than "Do you like your meal?". Spark curiosity, room for discussion, go deeper, ask "Why?".  

I think also being open to talking about anything and treating it as (almost equal) importance as if you were talking about something else. Of course, if a friend is going through a hard time then conversations surrounding that would be more important, and require greater attention, but also don't go dismissing topics as meaningless or boring. There exists no concrete definition of "meaningless" or "boring" conversation so don't be the one to create the definition!  

Likely this is just mostly another symptom of being ill.
