~ additional invaluable experiences i have had

### **𖦹 Playing Volleyball**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication, Commitment**      
📅 **2017 - 2023**  
📍 **UK** 

Initially, I played in a local team when I was younger and got to take part in regional competitions, enabling me to gain more confidence in myself and meet new people. The team also consisted of adults, most of whom had families or were working full time jobs but I was glad they all still made time for their passion. During the pandemic, I stopped playing from 2019 to 2021 but started again when I joined the University of Bristol Women's C Team in 2022. Being part of the university team felt like a lot of commitment with 2 trainings and a match a week. I am seriously amazed by the dedication everyone on a sports team has! For second year I chose to sacrifice volleyball for a greater breadth of activites (salsa, swimming, running, and increasing my visits to the gym) to explore new hobbies. 

### **𖦹 Gold, Silver and Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Awards**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication**      
📅 **June 2022 - Sep 2022**  
📍 **UK**  

Ah yes, I was told by everyone around me that [Duke of Edinburgh (DofE)](https://www.dofe.org/) would be my way of getting into university. In hindsight, I am not sure how true that is but I certainly learnt a lot from it.

It helped provide a motivation for me to try different sports, volunteering roles, and develop new skills or hobbies. My parents only moved to the UK after I was born so were unaware of the clubs I could become involved in. Consequently, I only started doing extracurricular clubs after starting DofE. I tried kickboxing, drama, baking, and joined a local volleyball club, which grew from 1 year to 5 years of volleyball. I kickstarted my running journey for Gold and went from seriously struggling to complete 1500m in PE to being able to do weekly 10ks. I volunteered at my local Beaver Scout group, as well as a local charity shop. Interacting with a variety of different customers was always fun and hugely improved my confidence in speaking to new people.

I was also lucky to have been able to hike along the beauitful Jurassic Coast (Silver Expedition) and Lake District (Gold Expedition). Never thought I would ever be immersed in such gorgeous nature!

### **𖦹 Conservation with John Muir Award – Flatford Mill**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication**      
📅 **June 2022 - Sep 2022**  
📍 **Flatford Mill, UK**  

As part of my Gold DofE, I needed to complete a 1-week residential of some sort. My friend suggested we go to Flatford Mill together as she had an interest in conservation. Having no previous knowledge in conservation, I decided to go too to learn more about it!

### **𖦹 Front of House Team Member at Wagamamas**   

🛠️ **Teamwork, Communication, Customer Service**      
📅 **June 2022 - Sep 2022**  
📍 **Devon, UK**  

Working at Wagamamas put me in a high pressure environment almost everday.
