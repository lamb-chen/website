Reasons I enjoy running.  

Running is one of my favourite tools to use to de-stress. If I am ever worried or upset about anything, running puts me back at ease and unties every knot in my chest. During the winter season my body becomes heavily deprived of vitamin D so once the sun is out, running is the perfect opportunity to soak it all in.  I love being able to socialise with friends on chatty runs and motivate each other along the way. It's a great way to bond! Usually I run similar routes or within familiar places so I do not have to check where I am going constantly. Though if I ever want to explore a place, running is perfect for unlocking new places.
