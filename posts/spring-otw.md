This morning I walked past a flowering tree adorned in cherry blossom, its petals already decorating the pavement. Strangely, the weather was the worst its been this week yet there was something uniquely *spring* in the air. I mulled over how different it *feels* to walk around the city both in the day and the night. The exact streets I have visited almost everyday since September suddenly provide a distinctly new perspective. Springs scent trails behind in the breeze. New fruits are displayed both in nature and supermarkets. I hope to see the sun again soon after its recent, short but sweet, sojourn. Let the new week begin!
