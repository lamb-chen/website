~ some stuff I enjoyed creating...  

### **𖦹 Kondo AI**     
🛠️ **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase**        
📅 **8-10 March 2024**    
📍 **Encode AI Hackathon, London, Canary Wharf**  
I attended the Encode AI Hackathon and met Ayush and John! Together with my two friends, we created Kondo AI during the Encode AI Hackathon.

Kondo AI is a floorplanning app that seamlessly transforms real products to scale. It leverages GPT Vision to create an AI companion for personalised reviews and ratings, and gamifies the overall user experience. With accurate scaling of room sizes and furniture it also reduces the hassle of measurement-taking. We further simplify the planning process by tracking both the total costs and physical placement of wishlist furniture items in one place. We have designed web scraping algorithms that reliably find key product content (photos, price, colour, dimensions). LLMs then enhance and structure the scraped content into a JSON object, which becomes translated into an precisely scaled and moveable furniture item within the user’s floor plan. These form building blocks the user can utilise to plan their layouts accurately, with real, to-scale products. Screenshots of their floor plans can be sent to GPT for item suggestions, layout review and budgeting advice.  

Kondo AI is a Next.js application, rendered on the frontend using HTML, Typescript, Javascript, CSS and IMGs. The backend is powered by Supabase.

### **𖦹 This blog !!**  

🛠️ **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Markdown**      
📅 **Feb 2024**   
Stumbling across [Benedict Neo's blog](https://www.bneo.xyz/), I became inspired to finally make my own website! I have always wanted to make a website and after 2 failed attempts over the years, I finally have created something I can build upon. Hoping to use this website as a portfolio, as well as a space to record things I have learnt and various thoughts. I wrote a [brief log](https://lambchen.vercel.app/posts/new-bloggings) documenting the initial creation of the blog. 


### **𖦹 Secret Santa Email Sender**  

🛠️ **Python**      
📅 **Dec 2022**     
My flatmates wanted to do Secret Santa but we struggled to all be together at the same place at the same time to draw out the names. This inspired me to automate and digitalise the process so we would no longer have to all together to get our Secret Santa names.

\(Sadly I did not know how to use Github at the time so did not create a repo for it and lost it when my hard drive broke T_T)

### **𖦹 Photo Gallery Website**  

🛠️ **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**      
📅 **Aug 2022**      
I created an interactive and responsive Photo Gallery for one of my projects during the Kode with Klossy Summer Programme. Captions for each image appear when the user taps or hovers over the image (depending on the device type). I loved collating all the memories over the past year and then sharing it with friends and family!
