An ongoing mission I have is to build a better picture of who I am. I want to pin point my exact strengths and weaknesses in hopes of discovering what I am suited for. 

#### Prompt questions
☆ What is it exactly that I enjoy and how can I do more of this?  
☆ What am I good at?  
☆ What am I not good at?  
☆ What would I like to improve?  
☆ Any mistakes I have made recently that I have learnt from?  
I will also try to find people that can help unpack things with me.   

### Strengths
#### 1. If I'm going to do something, I'm doing it right
When completing tasks I am passionate about and set on doing, it will be done with the utmost effort and dedication.    
#### 2. Excited character
I easily build excitement around tasks, events and ideas quickly. 

  
### Weaknesses  
#### 1. Not assertive enough  
In some situations I do not speak my mind as much as I should.  


### Areas I am improving
#### 1. Articulation and presenting.
I enjoy presenting but I want to be more confident when I speak, more fluid and engaging. During presentations I get flustered which I translate into energy and passion in my speech but I sometimes feel I need to slooowww dooowwwnn. Improved articulation of my ideas and works is something

### Lessons I have learnt
#### 1. Word choice is important
Recently, I was struggling to ask data analyst about the most unexpected insight she had discovered from testing. I was asking it in a completely roundabout way meaning it took much longer to arrive at mutual understanding of what it was I was asking. From this I really realised the importance of choosing the right words. Simple rephrasing can help people understand so much easier.     
   
I also saw a youtube comment saying to elicit narrative responses. Do not ask questions or prompts that could result in a plain yes or no answer. For example, "What do you like about the meal?" rather than "Do you like your meal?". In my conversations I hope to create more depth and meaning to them - spark curiosity, create a space for greater discussion, go deeper, ask "Why?". 

#### 2. Less is more
