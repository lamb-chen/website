I was given some advice for writing today and wanted to jot it down!    

> Imagine a specific person who you are writing to. For example, a fellow student, or a technical expert.   

By thinking of an exact person, it makes the writing process easier as you the style and tone of writing will naturally adapt. People are more likely to gravitate towards it since it is more directed.   

This resonated with me as it makes the process of writing less daunting. I feel more comfortable imagining my flatmates rather than the *entire internet*.     

If you want to write about something you are not knowledgeable about, then that's okay! You can always document the journey and progress of learning and exploring topics.
