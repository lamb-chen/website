ello! 

i'm lamb - a second year computer science student at the [university of bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). creating this blog has been a lot of fun though it made me realise how daunting it is to work from a clean slate. still trying to decide how i want this all to look!     

how would i describe myself...    
i certainly have a lot of energy - definitely more than my body can hold! it ends up overflowing and gets absorbed by any task i do or interaction i have with other people!

academically, i am building an interest in the applications of computer science within healthcare and am a believer in the improvements that can result from embracing more technology! also trying to explore a lot of opportunities and develop a better understanding of what roles and projects i am most suited for.
