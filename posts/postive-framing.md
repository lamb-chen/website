Anything I think is in my control. There are plenty of avenues I can take, and different perspectives I can view everything from. The key is to remember this so you don't fall foul of chasing that rabbit down the rabbithole. Focusing on every negative or "unhelpful" thought that comes into my head, I will more actively try to channel the power of flipping it. All sentences have various ways of re-phrasing and the words that drift into my mind are no different. Unlocking the ability to utilise this mighty skill is important to me.
