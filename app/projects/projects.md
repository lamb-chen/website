~ some stuff I enjoyed creating...

### **𖦹 This blog !!**  

🛠️ **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Markdown**      
📅 **Feb 2024**   
Stumbling across [Benedict Neo's blog](https://www.bneo.xyz/), I became inspired to finally make my own website! I have always wanted to make a website and after 2 failed attempts over the years, I finally have created something I can build upon. Hoping to use this website as a portfolio, as well as a space to record things I have learnt and various thoughts. I wrote a [brief log](https://lambchen.vercel.app/posts/new-bloggings) documenting the initial creation of the blog. 


### **𖦹 Secret Santa Email Sender**  

🛠️ **Python**      
📅 **Dec 2022**     
My flatmates wanted to do Secret Santa but we struggled to all be together at the same place at the same time to draw out the names. This inspired me to automate and digitalise the process so we would no longer have to all together to get our Secret Santa names.

\(Sadly I did not know how to use Github at the time so did not create a repo for it and lost it when my hard drive broke T_T)

### **𖦹 Photo Gallery Website**  

🛠️ **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**      
📅 **Aug 2022**      
I created an interactive and responsive Photo Gallery for one of my projects during the Kode with Klossy Summer Programme. Captions for each image appear when the user taps or hovers over the image (depending on the device type). I loved collating all the memories over the past year and then sharing it with friends and family!
