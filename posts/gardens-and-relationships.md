You have your own garden. A relationship that grows slowly and organically is like a seed planted into your garden. A relationship that grows suddenly and inorganically is like a fully developed plant that gets planted into your garden. The former is often better as the plant can grow slowly and adapt to the environment it has been planted into. Meanwhile, the latter is less likely to survive as it was grown in a potenitally completely new environment. Once it gets planted into your garden, it may in fact wilt from too harsh sun, or be unable to cope with the acidity of the soil. This is similar to when relationships form almost immediately and are often quite intense. There is a high chance you realise you are not as compatible for one another as you first thought.
