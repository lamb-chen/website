Yesterday marked the first day of my week of pure deep relaxation! After visiting my friend in Southampton for a day, I am now already on the train heading back home but feeling completely relaxed. I have come to realise that resting does not work instantaneously for me. If I feel overwhelmed or burnt out, a day or two of rest does not automatically equate to feeling well rested. Granted, this is biased as I spent the past week recovering from being ill but nonetheless, it is a process and certain mindset I have to equip. The concept of deep work paired with deep relaxation encapsulates this and set my intentions for the coming week. I have an awful habit of trying to maximise my time (e.g. reading lecture notes whilst eating lunch) and have tasks I need to complete constantly ruminating the back of my brain in an endless loop. From this realisation I decided I want to spend my time more intentionally rather than having my attention split between multiple tasks. If I am going to eat, I am going to eat and only eat. Eating with company is even better of course. By doing this I know I can feel less all over the place and more centered. Overall I want to consume/produce less quantity, but also consume/produce more quality.     

To support this, I have been trying to listen to less music and podcasts as I do other tasks, with the exception of walking/being with people. The constant stream of noise is just adding to the overstimulation and I disguise it as passively learning and absorbing knowledge.

Most mornings this past week I have eaten my breakfast whilst intermittently staring out the kitchen window blankly. I have enjoyed letting my thoughts float, in, out, wherever, whenever. Slow mornings are much nicer than rushed and chaotic mornings! I should really remind myself this as I resist rising from the warmth of my bed each day.      

Then again, this is all just extrapolations from a random thought during a train journey. I may end up disagreeing with these ramblings by tomorrow.
